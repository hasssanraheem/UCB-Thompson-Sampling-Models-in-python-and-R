# UCB-Thompson-Sampling-Models-in-python-and-R
This repository provides implementations of two reinforcement learning techniques in Python and R: Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling. Each algorithm is organized in its own folder with clean code, datasets or simulation scripts, and step-by-step explanations for experimenting with multi-armed bandit problems.
